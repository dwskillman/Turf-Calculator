Step 1: Prepping the Ground,"Step one is prepping the ground. Since we're working with a new build, there’s no need to remove any grass. But for those of you replacing natural grass, you’ll want to start by clearing away debris, rocks, and any weeds. This is crucial to give your turf a solid, clean foundation. You want to make sure the surface is level before moving forward. If you’ve got poor drainage, adding a French drain or extra layers of crushed rock in low spots will help water flow away from the turf, preventing pooling underneath.","If your lawn has poor drainage or low spots, you might want to install a French drain or add layers of crushed rock to help water flow away from your turf. This will prevent pooling and keep the base dry, which is key for long-lasting turf.",Wide shot of the dirt lawn with tools. Close-ups of debris removal and leveling.
Step 2: Laying the Base Layer,"Next, we’re going to lay down the base layer. I recommend using crushed rock or decomposed granite, aiming for about 3-4 inches of material. This layer acts like a foundation, providing stability while also aiding in drainage. The key here is to spread it evenly across the entire area.","Take your time with this step. A well-prepared base ensures a level and long-lasting installation. If you’re working with an uneven yard, use a rake to spread the material and create a gentle slope, ideally away from any buildings, to help with water runoff.","Footage of crushed rock being poured onto the surface, spreading material evenly."
Step 3: Packing the Base Layer,"Now, it’s time to compact the base. Use a plate compactor to pack the material down. This ensures the surface is level and firm. Be sure to lightly mist the base with water before compacting—it'll help bind the material together more effectively. If you notice any low spots after compacting, just add more material and compact again.","Mist the base lightly with water before compacting. This will help bind the material together more effectively and create a stable surface. If you notice any low spots after compacting, just add more material and compact again.","Plate compactor in use, misting base with water, compacting the material."
Step 4: Measuring the Area,"Now, we need to measure the area. Get accurate measurements to avoid waste and ensure the turf fits perfectly. For corners and curved areas, it’s important to use a flexible measuring tape to help you get precise measurements.","Measure twice, cut once! Double-check all dimensions to avoid any costly mistakes when cutting the turf.",Demonstrate using a measuring tape to measure area and take accurate dimensions.
Step 5: Cutting the Turf to Length,Roll out the turf and mark your cuts. Use a sharp utility knife to carefully cut along the backing. It’s always better to cut slightly larger than you need—you can always trim any excess once the turf is in place.,"Cutting from the back of the turf, where the grid backing is visible, will help you get straighter, cleaner lines. This also helps prevent fraying along the edges.","Roll out turf, measure and mark where to cut, use sharp utility knife."
Step 6: Laying the Turf,"Once the turf is cut, it’s time to lay it out over the base. Let it sit for a while to relax—this helps eliminate any creases or wrinkles that might have formed during transportation. Make sure the grass blades all face the same direction when you lay down your pieces. This is a crucial step that’s often overlooked. If the blades are facing different ways, your turf will look uneven and may have a shiny, plastic-like appearance.","Make sure the grass blades all face the same direction when you lay down your pieces. This is a crucial step to maintain a consistent, natural look.","Lay turf over the base, check blade direction, let turf relax, and smooth out wrinkles."
Step 7: Cutting Around Obstacles,"Next, it’s time to cut around obstacles like trees, planters, or walkways. Use a sharp utility knife for clean, precise cuts. Take your time here—it’s all about making sure the turf fits seamlessly around these features.","When cutting around trees or other circular obstacles, make radial cuts like the spokes of a wheel. This ensures a snug, seamless fit around the object.","Cutting around trees and obstacles with precision, ensuring a perfect fit."
Step 8: Stretching the Turf,Stretching the turf is one of the most important steps to avoid wrinkles. Use a carpet kicker or simply stretch it by hand to get rid of any wrinkles or bumps.,"Stretch the turf from the center of the area outward. This ensures that the tension is distributed evenly across the entire surface, which will help prevent any sagging or bunching later on.","Use of carpet kicker, stretching turf evenly, pulling from the center outward."
Step 9: Seaming the Turf,"Seaming the turf is a critical step. Instead of using glue, we use the S curve cut method to ensure an invisible seam. This allows the turf to fit together seamlessly without any visible seams. Once the cuts are made, we nail the pieces down along the seam to keep everything secure.","The S curve cut ensures that the seams blend perfectly together. Once the cuts are made, we nail the pieces down along the seam to keep everything secure. It’s a technique that holds up well, especially in Arizona’s hot temperatures, where glue might not be the best option.","S curve cuts made along edges, nailing the turf down with seamless results."
Step 10: Nailing the Turf Down,"Once the turf is stretched, it's time to secure it with nails or turf staples. Place them about every 6 inches along the perimeter to keep everything in place.",Drive the nails at a slight angle to avoid pulling the turf too tightly in one spot. This will help the turf stay in place and keep the edges from curling.,"Nailing or stapling turf along the perimeter, securing edges."
Step 11: Applying the Infill,"Finally, we apply the infill. This helps the blades of grass stand upright, adds weight to keep everything in place, and ensures that your turf looks natural.","Use a drop spreader to distribute the infill evenly, and then brush it into the fibers with a power broom or regular broom. Apply the infill evenly across the surface, going over the area twice to ensure proper coverage.",Spreading and brushing in the infill to complete the look of the turf.
