NARRATOR (Owner of The Turf Yard):
"Hey everyone! Welcome to The Turf Yard DIY guide. Today, we’re installing **Lush 80 artificial turf**, our most popular turf option. It's known for its durability and realistic look, and it's perfect for both residential and commercial properties. Let's walk through the steps for installing it at your home."

PRO TIP:
"Lush 80 is one of the most realistic and durable artificial turfs available. Its 80-ounce pile weight means it’s thicker, more durable, and stands up better to heavy foot traffic than lighter options. Plus, it’s UV stabilized, so it resists fading under the Arizona sun. Whether you're replacing grass or building from scratch, Lush 80 will give you a lush, vibrant lawn that looks and feels just like natural grass—without the maintenance."

[Step 1: Prepping the Ground]

NARRATOR:
"Step one is prepping the ground. Since we're working with a new build, there’s no need to remove any grass. But for those of you replacing natural grass, you’ll want to start by clearing away debris, rocks, and any weeds. This is crucial to give your turf a solid, clean foundation. You want to make sure the surface is level before moving forward. If you’ve got poor drainage, adding a French drain or extra layers of crushed rock in low spots will help water flow away from the turf, preventing pooling underneath."

Tools Needed:
- **Landscaping rake** for leveling the surface
- **Shovel** for clearing debris
- **French drain** (optional for areas with poor drainage)

PRO TIP:
"If your lawn has poor drainage or low spots, you might want to install a French drain or add layers of crushed rock to help water flow away from your turf. This will prevent pooling and keep the base dry, which is key for long-lasting turf."

[Step 2: Laying the Base Layer]
(Footage of quarter minus being poured onto the cleared surface.)

NARRATOR:
"Next, we’re going to lay down the base layer. We use a material called **quarter minus**, which consists of crushed granite or crushed rock. It’s the ideal material for creating a stable base and improving drainage. Aim for about 3-4 inches of quarter minus for your base layer."

Tools Needed:
- **Landscaping rake** for spreading material
- **Plate compactor** to firm the base

PRO TIP:
"Take your time with this step. A well-prepared base ensures a level and long-lasting installation. If you’re working with an uneven yard, use a **landscaping rake** to spread the material and create a gentle slope, ideally away from any buildings, to help with water runoff."

---

[Step 3: Packing the Base Layer]
(Shot of a plate compactor being used to compact the base.)

NARRATOR:
"Now, it’s time to compact the base. Use a **plate compactor** for this step. It’s used to compact the crushed rock and create a firm, level surface. Plate compactors are available for rent at most home improvement stores or can be purchased through The Turf Yard."

Tools Needed:
- **Plate compactor** for compacting the base
- **Water misting** (optional, to help bind the material)

PRO TIP:
"Mist the base lightly with water before compacting. This will help bind the material together more effectively and create a stable surface. If you notice any low spots after compacting, just add more material and compact again."

---

[Step 4: Measuring the Area]
(Demonstrate using a measuring tape to record dimensions.)

NARRATOR:
"Now, we need to measure the area. Get accurate measurements to avoid waste and ensure the turf fits perfectly. For corners and curved areas, it’s important to use a flexible measuring tape to help you get precise measurements."

Tools Needed:
- **Measuring tape** for accurate measurements

[Step 5: Cutting the Turf to Length]
(Show a roll of Lush 80 artificial turf being unrolled and cut.)

NARRATOR:
"Roll out the turf and mark your cuts. Use a sharp **utility knife** to carefully cut along the backing. It’s always better to cut slightly larger than you need—you can always trim any excess once the turf is in place."

Tools Needed:
- **Utility knife** for cutting the turf
- **Cutting mat** (optional, to protect surfaces)

PRO TIP:
"Cutting from the back of the turf, where the grid backing is visible, will help you get straighter, cleaner lines. This also helps prevent fraying along the edges."

---

[Step 6: Laying the Turf]
(Show the turf being positioned over the base.)

NARRATOR:
"Once the turf is cut, it’s time to lay it out over the base. Let it sit for a while to relax—this helps eliminate any creases or wrinkles that might have formed during transportation. Make sure the grass blades all face the same direction when you lay down your pieces. This is a crucial step that’s often overlooked. If the blades are facing different ways, your turf will look uneven and may have a shiny, plastic-like appearance."

Tools Needed:
- **Gloves** for handling turf
- **Knee pads** for comfort during installation

PRO TIP:
"Make sure the grass blades all face the same direction when you lay down your pieces. This is a crucial step to maintain a consistent, natural look. Ideally, you want the blades to face toward the house or toward the street to ensure the best visual appearance."

[Step 7: Cutting Around Obstacles]

NARRATOR:
"Next, it’s time to cut around obstacles like trees, planters, or walkways. Use a sharp **utility knife** for clean, precise cuts. Take your time here—it’s all about making sure the turf fits seamlessly around these features."

Tools Needed:
- **Utility knife** for cutting around obstacles
- **Scissors** for smaller, more intricate cuts (optional)

PRO TIP:
"When cutting around trees or other circular obstacles, make radial cuts like the spokes of a wheel. This ensures a snug, seamless fit around the object."

---

[Step 8: Stretching the Turf]
(Demonstrate pulling the turf taut.)

NARRATOR:
"Stretching the turf is one of the most important steps to avoid wrinkles. Use a **carpet kicker** or simply stretch it by hand to get rid of any wrinkles or bumps."

Tools Needed:
- **Carpet kicker** for stretching
- **Stretching tool** (optional for additional tension)

PRO TIP:
"Stretch the turf from the center of the area outward. This ensures that the tension is distributed evenly across the entire surface, which will help prevent any sagging or bunching later on."

---

[Step 9: Seaming the Turf]
(Close-up of seaming turf with special tools.)

NARRATOR:
"Seaming the turf is a critical step. Instead of using glue, we use the **S curve cut method** to ensure an invisible seam. This allows the turf to fit together seamlessly without any visible seams. Once the cuts are made, we nail the pieces down along the seam to keep everything secure."

Tools Needed:
- **Utility knife** for S curve cuts
- **Turf staples or nails** for securing the seams

PRO TIP:
"The S curve cut ensures that the seams blend perfectly together. Once the cuts are made, we nail the pieces down along the seam to keep everything secure. It’s a technique that holds up well, especially in Arizona’s hot temperatures, where glue might not be the best option."

[Step 10: Nailing the Turf Down]
(Show nails or staples being used along the perimeter.)

NARRATOR:
"Once the turf is stretched, it's time to secure it with **nails** or **turf staples**. Place them about every 6 inches along the perimeter to keep everything in place."

Tools Needed:
- **Turf staples** or **nails** for securing the turf
- **Hammer** or **staple gun**

PRO TIP:
"Drive the nails at a slight angle to avoid pulling the turf too tightly in one spot. This will help the turf stay in place and keep the edges from curling."

[Step 11: Applying the Infill]
(Footage of infill being spread and brushed in.)

NARRATOR:
"Finally, we apply the **infill**. This helps the blades of grass stand upright, adds weight to keep everything in place, and ensures that your turf looks natural."

Tools Needed:
- **Drop spreader** for distributing infill
- **Power broom** or regular broom for brushing it in

PRO TIP:
"Use a **drop spreader** to distribute the infill evenly, and then brush it into the fibers with a power broom or regular broom. Apply the infill evenly across the surface, going over the area twice to ensure proper coverage. You can purchase infill directly through The Turf Yard."
