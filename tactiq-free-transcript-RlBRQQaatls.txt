00:00:02.679 hey what's going on everybody my name is
00:00:04.359 Seth and I am with Elite Turf Supply and
00:00:06.520 today we are going to show you an
00:00:08.240 eight-step process for an entire Turf
00:00:10.759 install so from A to Z we're going to
00:00:12.440 cover dig out Bas prep laying the grass
00:00:15.040 putting infill in so if you're in Utah
00:00:17.000 Idaho we can supply straight to your
00:00:19.439 door so if you're looking for supplies
00:00:20.800 or you're looking for installers check
00:00:22.199 the link in the description you can find
00:00:23.800 us online or on Instagram we can help
00:00:25.680 you from start to finish with your
00:00:27.119 install and give you materials that best
00:00:29.000 fit your needs so the first step is
00:00:30.759 determining what materials you're going
00:00:32.800 to need to complete the job so for
00:00:34.920 finishing the job you'll need Turf
00:00:37.160 infill seam tape nails and glue the
00:00:40.320 tools if you don't already own them um
00:00:42.160 it's going to be pickaxes shovels
00:00:44.440 wheelbarrows um a plate compactor is
00:00:46.719 very important to finish the grass all
00:00:49.280 we're going to need is hammers carpet
00:00:51.680 kickers razor blades um that'll pretty
00:00:54.399 much be able to get the job done from
00:00:55.879 start to finish so the three most common
00:00:58.239 types of grass that we install for
00:00:59.960 residential yards are going to be our
00:01:01.879 Elite 82 our Elite 108 and our Elite 94
00:01:06.400 the most popular Turf that we uh we see
00:01:09.040 the most people pick is the elite 82 it
00:01:11.280 has a really bright vibrant look to it
00:01:14.040 kind of has that fresh spring look you
00:01:15.880 know it makes your house pop it also is
00:01:17.720 very soft to the touch and that's
00:01:19.119 attractive to a lot of people all right
00:01:21.040 so an important step to consider when
00:01:23.640 you're thinking about installing Turf is
00:01:26.720 seeing if you're if you're doing a
00:01:28.040 backyard or a front yard if you're
00:01:29.880 windows are casting any harsh
00:01:31.520 Reflections to where the grass might be
00:01:33.399 laid if the windows are reflecting they
00:01:35.360 they get pretty hot so when it reflects
00:01:36.840 onto the grass it'll actually melt the
00:01:38.399 turf we call it turf burn so what I do
00:01:40.640 when I do my installs is if I have a job
00:01:42.920 I will come to the house usually in in
00:01:45.200 the morning midday and at the end of the
00:01:47.000 day depending on if it's facing west or
00:01:49.640 east and I will determine if there is
00:01:51.520 any Reflections that are going to
00:01:53.079 potentially harm the grass all righty so
00:01:55.000 we are cutting ahead a little bit
00:01:56.759 further into our our day in the install
00:01:58.719 we have our window tint guys throwing up
00:02:00.840 Contra Vision window film up on this
00:02:02.960 window right here now not every job is
00:02:05.119 is exactly the same so um before you
00:02:08.119 start to you know install your Turf get
00:02:10.160 outside make sure to check that the
00:02:12.080 windows aren't reflecting onto the grass
00:02:14.720 or where it's going to be um if you can
00:02:16.760 prevent turf burn later on down the road
00:02:18.640 that's what you're looking for um so
00:02:20.319 just take take that into precaution when
00:02:22.080 you are installing Turf um and then from
00:02:24.599 there get windows tinted if needed so
00:02:27.160 once you have your Turf materials and
00:02:29.120 once you have tinted your windows if
00:02:31.040 needed the next step is going to be the
00:02:32.920 dig out process so from here we're going
00:02:35.239 to dig out 4 in of existing sod most of
00:02:38.319 the time we're digging out grass cuz
00:02:39.879 we're replacing and saving water for
00:02:41.879 homeowners so what we use to dig out if
00:02:44.360 it's a smaller yard if we don't have the
00:02:46.800 best access we will just do pickaxes and
00:02:48.920 shovels if the yard has access for a
00:02:51.599 dingo or a skidsteer or possibly an
00:02:53.720 excavator that will speed up the dig out
00:02:56.040 process in this yard we're just doing it
00:02:58.080 by hand so we're going to start by by
00:02:59.879 digging out 4 in getting all this sought
00:03:01.879 out and then we're going to bring in our
00:03:02.800 base
00:03:03.510 [Music]
00:03:09.000 material so when we're digging out and
00:03:11.200 if we have cement along our border which
00:03:12.920 is ideal as soon as you see this slag
00:03:15.360 slag is just the bottom part of the
00:03:16.920 cement that's unfinished this stuff
00:03:18.519 right here as soon as I see that that's
00:03:20.680 how I know I'm at the correct depth for
00:03:22.560 putting my base in most people will say
00:03:24.640 hey what about my gas lines gas lines
00:03:26.599 usually don't come into effect when
00:03:27.959 we're when we're installing Turf cuz
00:03:29.280 we're only out 4 in gas lines are
00:03:31.439 usually buried in between 18 and 24 in
00:03:33.680 below the ground so if you are concerned
00:03:35.439 about it you know call Blue staks have
00:03:37.200 them come out here stake out where the
00:03:38.920 gas lines are but because we don't dig
00:03:40.760 that deep um 4 in is is usually um
00:03:43.760 perfect for our dig out and then once
00:03:45.200 you've dug out your sod the the best way
00:03:47.280 to dispose of it is to just take it to a
00:03:48.959 green waste dump normally you'll have to
00:03:50.760 pay a few bucks to to get it dumped but
00:03:53.360 that's the that's what we use as a a
00:03:54.920 common practice to get rid of our
00:03:56.200 existing
00:03:57.400 sod when we find a sprinkler like this
00:03:59.920 you can cap these sprinklers I myself
00:04:01.959 like to remove all the PVC cuz in the
00:04:04.360 event that the valve isn't shut off or
00:04:07.040 whatever just preparing for the worst if
00:04:09.159 they do a blowout and there's a a broken
00:04:11.239 pipe or something and it bursts
00:04:12.840 underneath the turf there's potential to
00:04:14.599 where all that water wherever it's
00:04:16.478 leaking is going to sink your base
00:04:18.279 material over time so what we'll do is
00:04:20.880 we'll dig a little trench here and see
00:04:22.400 if we can find our PVC depending on how
00:04:24.120 deep it is um and when you dig a trench
00:04:26.199 and you reberry it recomp compacting
00:04:28.160 that trench is very important if you
00:04:29.680 don't recompacted trench stuff will
00:04:31.280 settle over time Turf might sink the
00:04:33.840 base might sink so it's just all about
00:04:36.000 taking precautions to make sure that
00:04:37.240 you're not called back you know within a
00:04:39.199 few weeks so going to dig a little
00:04:40.600 trench here find the PVC see if we can
00:04:43.000 remove it all or just need to cap
00:04:46.600 it when installing artificial grass it's
00:04:49.840 very crucial to have a hard Edge to to
00:04:52.759 uh secure your Turf to so in this yard
00:04:55.080 we have a decent amount of cement we
00:04:57.320 have we have a mowing curb we have a
00:04:59.160 little patio here um and then along the
00:05:01.639 fence line we obviously have our our
00:05:03.400 white vinyl fence so um with this
00:05:05.759 curbing right here this is ideal for
00:05:08.479 installing Turf against in in my own
00:05:10.360 opinion it's a solid solid uh Edge to
00:05:13.720 where the base isn't going to you know
00:05:16.160 bow it out or anything like that it's
00:05:17.520 really solid so it's going to hold up
00:05:18.759 for a long time um if you don't have
00:05:21.000 cement poured and you're looking to find
00:05:23.520 an edging as a replacement I would
00:05:25.560 recommend using Bender board or like
00:05:27.639 black metal edging or some sort of
00:05:29.160 compos Clos it Lumber um TRX decking can
00:05:31.680 be a really solid edging for the
00:05:34.280 perimeter of a yard you just dig it down
00:05:36.160 create a little trench stake it in
00:05:37.680 create your hard Edge and then build
00:05:39.240 your base up to it from
00:05:41.199 there where' that pipe
00:05:45.360 go so after you have everything dug out
00:05:48.400 your next step is to prep the ground
00:05:50.840 with your base material base is easily
00:05:53.280 the most important part of any install
00:05:55.880 because however your base looks is
00:05:57.639 exactly how your Turf is going to look
00:05:59.199 so if if you have weird low spots or
00:06:01.000 high spots somewhere in your yard those
00:06:02.800 are going to stick out kind of like a
00:06:04.160 sore thumb the material that we're using
00:06:06.319 for our Base today is called Blended
00:06:08.080 borrow for base material uh a lot of
00:06:10.680 people are familiar with road base um
00:06:13.120 road base is you know commonly used in
00:06:15.639 landscaping and construction the reason
00:06:17.599 that we don't usually use road base for
00:06:19.479 Turf install is because it doesn't drain
00:06:21.199 as well when you're prepping for a Turf
00:06:22.880 install your base needs to be permeable
00:06:25.240 so Blended B has squeegee mixed into the
00:06:27.319 aggregate which makes it permeable when
00:06:29.039 it's packed at 96% if you can't get
00:06:31.680 Blended borrow uh what I like to use is
00:06:33.919 a combination of 3/4 in gravel and
00:06:36.039 Crusher fines so I'll do 2 and 1/2 in of
00:06:39.000 3/4 in gravel and then an inch and a
00:06:40.800 half of Crusher fines the gravel is
00:06:42.759 going to be used as a drain Basin and
00:06:44.759 then the crusher finds is for my top
00:06:46.479 layer cuz I want the top layer to be
00:06:48.000 very smooth a smooth top layer will
00:06:50.720 ensure that you have a sharp looking
00:06:52.400 install at the end so we got our Blended
00:06:54.440 borrow delivered today so you're going
00:06:56.319 to see us filling it up with
00:06:57.800 wheelbarrows Wheeling it out dumpl it in
00:06:59.879 piles and then spreading it out evenly I
00:07:02.599 don't want this the runoff to go towards
00:07:05.039 your house and you know potentially
00:07:06.440 flood your basement so what I want to do
00:07:08.039 is I want the yard to slope away from
00:07:10.240 the house so we don't have any further
00:07:12.400 problems down the
00:07:13.350 [Music]
00:07:25.639 road what we're going to do here in
00:07:27.759 between us like prepping our base
00:07:30.039 is we're going to roll out our grass to
00:07:31.560 sit in the Sun for a little bit most
00:07:33.440 Turf products are going to be
00:07:35.000 polyurethane which basically means that
00:07:37.479 if once it sits in the sun it's going to
00:07:39.199 expand a little bit and then when it's
00:07:40.639 cold it's going to contract so when
00:07:42.560 you're installing Turf you want to
00:07:43.800 expand it as much as possible so you
00:07:45.400 don't get waves or wrinkles in your yard
00:07:47.800 later on down the road should be pretty
00:07:49.720 relaxed by the time we're ready to
00:07:51.870 [Music]
00:07:55.120 install our next step after we have all
00:07:57.800 of our base in our base is leveled out
00:08:00.000 pretty good here we're going to get
00:08:01.360 ready for compaction the the most
00:08:03.199 important part Watering your base so
00:08:05.680 water is going to be really helpful for
00:08:07.639 the compaction rate of your base
00:08:09.199 material once I have my base to where I
00:08:10.879 want it to be I'll give it a really good
00:08:12.680 soak I'll soak it down and then I let it
00:08:14.879 sit for like 10 minutes and then I'll
00:08:16.360 run the compactor over it one time get
00:08:18.639 nice and flat and then I'll check to see
00:08:20.919 if I have any low spots or high spots
00:08:23.280 that I need to kind of go over and fix
00:08:25.639 look at the bottom right now so this is
00:08:27.560 what happens it creates ridges that it's
00:08:29.240 it's not going to give you a smooth
00:08:30.280 compaction so it was a little too wet
00:08:33.479 when we started and this is what we
00:08:35.200 don't want well handy margin trial
00:08:37.320 usually does the
00:08:38.169 [Music]
00:08:41.159 trick the the hand tampers that we that
00:08:44.039 we use that are over there the hand
00:08:45.279 tampers are really helpful for around
00:08:47.399 the perimeter and the the compactor will
00:08:49.600 naturally create like little ridges from
00:08:51.920 each pass that you make and once we're
00:08:53.760 done like fully compacting we'll go
00:08:55.040 around with the hand tampers and just
00:08:56.279 take those ridges out but the plate
00:08:58.320 compactor is super important to make
00:09:01.360 sure that your base is compacted at you
00:09:03.160 know we're shooting for like a 96%
00:09:05.040 compaction rate trying to hand Tamp 4 in
00:09:07.560 of base is really hard to get it
00:09:09.560 perfectly compacted so I would recommend
00:09:12.040 100% of the time unless you have a patch
00:09:14.640 that's like a 5x5 sure but anything
00:09:17.640 above that Home Depot Diamond Rental
00:09:20.680 there's a bunch of power equipment
00:09:21.839 rentals expect to rent it out for at
00:09:23.880 least a half day take it back but if you
00:09:26.040 want your job to go smoothly and quickly
00:09:28.200 and efficiently play compactor is the
00:09:30.360 way to
00:09:30.710 [Music]
00:09:39.079 go so it's kind of hard to tell like
00:09:41.880 from this angle if we're like high or
00:09:44.240 low some people use a laser level I got
00:09:46.440 a laser level built in right here so I
00:09:48.760 just get down on my belly take a gander
00:09:51.320 at where my base is sitting where's the
00:09:53.839 low spot right there so for this low
00:09:57.720 spot right here we'll just throw some
00:09:59.160 shovels and just kind of rake it out
00:10:00.640 make it look a little better that Crest
00:10:02.680 right there that might look nice however
00:10:04.880 low spot crests look okay low spots
00:10:07.240 don't look good and this is also why you
00:10:09.920 order a little bit more base than what
00:10:11.519 you think you
00:10:14.360 need so if you need to determine how
00:10:16.680 much base you need just type in like
00:10:19.399 aggregate or Rock calculator type in
00:10:21.760 your square footage what size aggregate
00:10:24.440 you're using and it'll tell you exactly
00:10:26.720 how many tons you're going to need for
00:10:28.839 um four Ines of
00:10:32.519 depth better so this High spot like I
00:10:35.920 said I'm not mad at having a little
00:10:37.880 Crest but if I were going to have a
00:10:39.560 Crest I would put it all the way through
00:10:41.279 the yard and have the whole thing go
00:10:42.959 like this but if it's just in one
00:10:44.600 section I'm not usually too happy with
00:10:46.600 that I want it to be pretty even all the
00:10:48.639 way around so on the high spot I'm just
00:10:50.440 going to bust up the area that it's
00:10:53.440 obviously a little too
00:10:55.510 [Music]
00:10:58.040 high
00:11:02.790 [Music]
00:11:06.320 anybody can install Turf the the process
00:11:08.519 is super simple if you watch these
00:11:10.040 videos or you call us and talk to us at
00:11:12.800 Elite we can walk you through pretty
00:11:14.320 much the whole process we'll give you
00:11:16.000 all the tools you need for how to get it
00:11:18.440 done we'll help you pick out your Turf
00:11:20.040 make sure you got the right base
00:11:21.160 material we'll help you measure your
00:11:22.360 yard it's very very attainable we've had
00:11:25.200 plenty of people who have done huge
00:11:27.240 yards DIY and it they've turned out
00:11:29.279 great so choc line M
00:11:33.120 dadd tuck it in pull it tight on both
00:11:37.490 [Music]
00:11:44.200 ends all right so when we are when we
00:11:46.519 were laying out artificial turf um
00:11:48.800 similar to real grass in some instances
00:11:50.680 is there's a grain there's a direction
00:11:52.880 of the grain so there's an up grain View
00:11:55.040 and there's a dow grain view so when
00:11:56.880 you're thinking about how to lay your
00:11:58.560 Turf out out it's wherever you're going
00:12:00.519 to look at it the most so in this
00:12:02.800 scenario they're going to come out from
00:12:04.320 their back door this way and they're
00:12:06.079 going to be looking up the turf right
00:12:08.800 here so we want to face the grain
00:12:11.200 towards the house cuz if you had it
00:12:13.199 flipped the other way it's going to look
00:12:14.639 really shiny and kind of plasticky if
00:12:16.600 you will um when you lay the grain this
00:12:19.240 way you see into the thatch layer and it
00:12:21.160 gives it a much darker color as well as
00:12:23.560 being able to see the thatch layer which
00:12:25.160 is all the dead blades that make it look
00:12:26.800 a little bit more realistic when it
00:12:28.399 comes to cutting Turf and maybe leaving
00:12:30.360 some over overhanging always order like
00:12:33.160 an extra foot cuz things happen you
00:12:35.279 don't quite know what what's going to
00:12:36.959 pop up when you're doing your install
00:12:38.320 and you never want to short yourself as
00:12:40.160 far as measuring your yard when you have
00:12:42.040 your your area laid out and you kind of
00:12:43.760 know where you're going to lay the grass
00:12:45.800 each of these rolls comes in a 15 ft
00:12:48.480 width so if you're going to do an S seam
00:12:51.440 or an invisible seam I always start from
00:12:53.600 the furthest uh point in my yard whether
00:12:56.360 I'm starting on the right or on the left
00:12:58.000 I'll go over 14 ft 6 in and then find my
00:13:01.839 longest length within that 14t 6 in and
00:13:04.639 then I'll keep going down until I'm done
00:13:06.480 the reason that I do 146 is to leave a
00:13:08.800 6-in overlap to create a seam that's
00:13:11.000 invisible all right so we are going to
00:13:13.480 start cutting our uh SE seam our
00:13:16.120 invisible seam um first I'm going to go
00:13:17.880 over uh the blades that I like to use or
00:13:20.639 normally if you just get a utility blade
00:13:22.199 like this um this does a great job the
00:13:24.240 thing about these blades is you you want
00:13:25.959 to change out this blade or at least
00:13:27.959 switch it every 10 ft when you're
00:13:29.839 cutting Turf it starts to fray out and
00:13:32.079 doesn't give you a clean Edge if you
00:13:33.639 have a dull blade so rotating your
00:13:35.880 blades and switching them out is very
00:13:37.160 important after we cut our seam we're
00:13:39.040 going to glue it down uh for extra
00:13:41.079 security it's really important to pick a
00:13:43.120 really solid strong glue as far as the
00:13:45.279 seaming process goes shout out to Joe
00:13:47.519 Watkins for hooking us up with these
00:13:49.360 seam tools just a quick little tidbit
00:13:51.279 general rule of thumb the curves the top
00:13:53.519 of the curve needs to be pointing at
00:13:55.759 where you cut this Turf from so don't
00:13:57.440 have it faced inside toward W your seam
00:13:59.720 you want to have it face to the outside
00:14:02.079 right here cuz this is what we're going
00:14:03.120 to be cutting off so the first step is
00:14:05.320 to measure down 9 in I'm going to take
00:14:08.320 my tape there I'm just going to make a
00:14:11.040 little Mark right where I know it is and
00:14:13.839 then I'm going to make a relief cut
00:14:15.120 right here I'm going to do the same
00:14:16.320 thing on the other
00:14:18.240 end so I have a 9 in mark on each side
00:14:21.800 and then what I'm going to do next is
00:14:23.680 I'm going to take this chalk line as a
00:14:26.360 uh a reference point then take it over
00:14:29.759 there to where we have that slit take
00:14:33.279 this and this is going to act as our
00:14:36.279 guide for the bottom of our seam tool so
00:14:38.000 we don't jump around and potentially you
00:14:40.800 know cut too much or not enough
00:14:43.279 something that I like to live by when it
00:14:44.959 comes to Turf is it's always better to
00:14:47.399 leave it a little long than it is to be
00:14:49.639 a little short because if you leave it
00:14:51.360 short and you have a gap that you're
00:14:53.079 going to be able to see you're going to
00:14:54.160 have to go back and patch that once I
00:14:56.240 have my 9in mark down and I snap a chalk
00:14:58.480 line on the bottom I'm going to take
00:15:00.120 this and on the first side I'm going to
00:15:02.680 line the edge of the turf up with the
00:15:05.120 flat part of this seam tool right here U
00:15:07.519 what I'm going to do here is make sure
00:15:09.040 that I'm on I'm on the line you can you
00:15:12.040 can use a marker and trace this seam
00:15:14.279 tool I prefer to hold it down and really
00:15:17.720 the the technique is to just make sure
00:15:19.480 that you're keeping the pressure of your
00:15:20.759 blade down and then up against the seam
00:15:23.680 tool and that'll that'll allow for a
00:15:25.360 pretty accurate cut
00:15:27.600 here
00:15:30.759 going to shift down a little bit
00:15:32.440 hopefully that makes
00:15:39.759 it all right so that's one side flip
00:15:43.759 this piece
00:15:44.920 [Music]
00:15:57.600 over
00:15:58.620 [Music]
00:16:05.160 these right here are carpet kickers that
00:16:08.440 I like to use to shift the grass around
00:16:10.720 you know obviously stretch it out get
00:16:12.000 all the wrinkles that you can a lot of
00:16:13.600 them come with these fine tooth blades
00:16:15.920 on them like this if it just has these
00:16:18.440 it's not the one you want what you want
00:16:19.959 is you want carpet kickers that have
00:16:21.600 this these extendable teeth on it cuz
00:16:23.720 when you go into the turf it's going to
00:16:25.160 grip it a lot easier than if it didn't
00:16:27.560 have any extendable teeth teth and if I
00:16:29.600 try to kick it like it doesn't it
00:16:31.480 doesn't grip and it just kind of like
00:16:32.680 skips over the turf so getting a carpet
00:16:34.480 kicker with extendable teeth is going to
00:16:36.160 be the way to go when you're when you're
00:16:38.639 stretching this grass so right here we
00:16:41.000 kind of cut our seam and uh now I'm just
00:16:43.720 getting it into place the Gap that I'm
00:16:45.759 looking for in between each piece of
00:16:47.440 turf is about an eighth of an inch the
00:16:49.920 same rule applies to the perimeter as
00:16:52.199 well so when you're trimming the edges
00:16:54.639 um you want to stay about an eighth
00:16:56.519 anywhere between an eighth and a quarter
00:16:58.040 if you can stay within that that's a
00:16:59.440 perfect Gap um any bigger than that
00:17:01.680 you're going to see your your edges
00:17:03.279 you're going to see the seam you want it
00:17:05.079 to be pretty tight but you don't want it
00:17:06.319 to be touching cuz right now I have a
00:17:07.839 little bit of overlap right here between
00:17:09.319 each piece and you can see that this
00:17:11.160 piece is sitting up higher than the
00:17:12.400 other one so if we didn't go back and
00:17:14.439 trim this you're going to have a mohawk
00:17:15.959 all the way down your seam um and that's
00:17:18.160 where you're going to see it so the
00:17:19.280 point of this invisible seam is to make
00:17:21.000 it you know so people don't catch it
00:17:23.679 with their eye you know a straight seam
00:17:26.000 uh most of the time you'll be able to
00:17:27.359 see it but the s seam is just that that
00:17:29.559 extra step that you can take to ensure
00:17:31.559 that you know it looks pristine and
00:17:34.640 perfect these right here are a 10-in
00:17:37.840 galvanized gutter Spike or a Timber tie
00:17:40.160 they have a spiral shape to them there's
00:17:41.880 10 different ways that you can install
00:17:44.240 tur what what I'm showing you today is
00:17:46.080 is kind of My Method um when it comes to
00:17:47.960 stretching there's a few different ways
00:17:49.440 you can do it so once you have your
00:17:50.840 grass laid out a very common practice in
00:17:53.600 the turf industry is to start from an
00:17:56.000 edge get it all trimmed up throw throw
00:17:58.559 some Nails in and then just kick
00:18:00.280 wrinkles out as you go and once you push
00:18:02.240 a wrinkle out you can actually throw a
00:18:04.080 nail into the grass um just to hold it
00:18:06.960 there for stretching the grass you know
00:18:08.640 you can let it sit out in the sun for a
00:18:10.039 long time the sun's your best friend
00:18:11.360 when you're installing this um it'll do
00:18:12.919 a pretty good job of expanding it
00:18:14.640 already so if you throw some Nails in
00:18:16.720 the middle just make sure that you're
00:18:17.840 using a carpet kicker as you go to work
00:18:20.240 those bubbles out to make sure that
00:18:21.799 we're not you know creating wrinkles um
00:18:24.360 for further on down the road now the
00:18:26.400 method that I'm going to use today uh is
00:18:28.960 one that is pretty specific to myself
00:18:32.640 and what all I'm doing is these big
00:18:34.440 nails they're not going to be sunk into
00:18:36.640 the turf they're just going to hold it
00:18:38.480 and anchor it while I'm stretching it in
00:18:40.520 my mind the further you stretch the
00:18:43.200 grass and it's tight as you can get it
00:18:45.720 once you pin down the edges it's there
00:18:47.720 it's not going to move and then at the
00:18:49.280 end once our seams are glued and our
00:18:51.159 edges are nailed we will go through and
00:18:53.039 pull all these out at the end when
00:18:54.880 you're driving any nail into the into
00:18:57.120 the turf whether you're Le leaving them
00:18:58.760 in there to secure it down or you're
00:19:00.880 using this method to just anchor it
00:19:02.880 while you're stretching there there's
00:19:04.320 Stitch rows in this grass so when they
00:19:05.880 manufacture it they Stitch it into rows
00:19:07.840 all up and down you never want to take
00:19:09.520 your nail in the middle of the Grass
00:19:11.120 Drive it down and then just hammer it in
00:19:14.600 cuz what that does is you're you're
00:19:16.320 catching these blades up here and you're
00:19:18.440 taking them down in into a hole and what
00:19:20.559 that looks like over the yard is just a
00:19:22.280 bunch of dimples all up and down the the
00:19:25.440 grass so um you want to make sure that
00:19:27.600 you're putting the nail in correctly to
00:19:29.360 avoid that so the way that I do that the
00:19:31.240 reason I me mentioned the Stitch rows
00:19:33.080 the Stitch rows go vertically like this
00:19:35.320 so what I do is I I take the nail which
00:19:37.039 is your best friend here I'm going to go
00:19:38.640 in between the Stitch rows and I'm going
00:19:40.840 to peel the grass back to where I just
00:19:42.679 see the backing of the turf so there's
00:19:44.600 these little rows right here and that's
00:19:46.120 where I want to put my nail so I'm not
00:19:47.679 taking any of the blades down with
00:19:51.640 it and I'm going to leave it sticking
00:19:53.600 out about like that now from here I'm
00:19:56.200 going to kind of stretch in a star
00:19:57.840 pattern
00:19:58.799 and since it's so hot today I'm not
00:20:00.600 going to be kicking very hard uh I'm
00:20:02.559 just simply Shifting the bubble out as I
00:20:04.320 go so from the first one just going to
00:20:07.200 kick a little bit push that Ripple
00:20:09.720 out kick a little
00:20:12.159 bit until I get to where I want to put
00:20:14.480 my next
00:20:16.120 nail and what's important is you can see
00:20:19.039 there's a little bubble that I brought
00:20:20.320 out from that last snail so once the
00:20:22.000 pressure is on my knee and I'm where I
00:20:23.280 want to be I'm going to do the same
00:20:24.520 thing that I just showed you I'm going
00:20:26.080 to put my nail in there spread the
00:20:27.640 blades so so I just find the backing I'm
00:20:30.240 not taking any blades down with
00:20:32.840 it and now I'm going to go and create a
00:20:35.360 little diamond shape so I'm going to go
00:20:37.320 forwards backwards and then side to side
00:20:39.440 to
00:20:43.240 begin spread the
00:20:46.559 blades now I'm going to go to the
00:20:48.960 side I'm going to kick push the Ripple
00:20:55.400 out so now I have a little diamond shape
00:20:58.440 right here I have one in the middle and
00:21:00.280 I have four on the perimeter so from
00:21:02.679 this point I'm going to stretch
00:21:05.520 diagonally just at kind of like a 45°
00:21:13.890 [Music]
00:21:16.320 angle when we're trimming edges you want
00:21:19.279 it to be fairly snug so I am going to
00:21:22.440 peel this back and have a Rough Guide of
00:21:25.360 where I need to be and these are Leaf
00:21:28.400 Cuts so I can move the grass a little
00:21:31.159 bit easier basically what we're looking
00:21:32.840 for when we're trimming an edge we don't
00:21:34.360 want it touching and we don't want it
00:21:36.080 too far away so when you're trimming you
00:21:38.080 want to be about an eighth of an inch
00:21:39.840 from the backing of your Turf to the
00:21:41.840 cement you can stay within an eighth of
00:21:43.799 an inch or a quarter but as soon as you
00:21:45.679 go too big um you're going to see that
00:21:48.080 and then if you're touching the cement
00:21:49.520 once you drive a nail in you're going to
00:21:51.200 create a bunch of bubbles behind there
00:21:53.360 so eth to a quarter is kind of the
00:21:54.919 general rule of thumb when we're cutting
00:21:56.200 Turf so right here I'm just going to
00:21:58.559 let my blade do the work and just trace
00:22:01.320 this cement and part of the reason I
00:22:03.960 like these these Milwaukee fastbacks a
00:22:07.000 lot is I use this what holds my blade as
00:22:10.360 like my guide for my Gap so if I peel
00:22:12.919 this back if that can fit and touches
00:22:15.919 both the backing and the cement that's
00:22:18.360 that's what I'm looking for you don't
00:22:19.720 want it touching not too far away you
00:22:21.320 just want to be able to see just a
00:22:22.600 little bit of the base and this is why
00:22:24.799 we leave a little bit overhanging cuz on
00:22:26.679 the edge if you trim off that last
00:22:28.480 little bit and you get to the blades
00:22:29.840 that are sticking straight up looks like
00:22:31.320 someone came here with a weed whip and
00:22:32.840 just edged your lawn so it'll look like
00:22:34.960 that 100% of the time which is pretty
00:22:36.320 cool so there's a couple different ways
00:22:38.039 that we can trim Turf when we're up
00:22:40.279 against a wall or a fence something like
00:22:42.240 this you could peel it back and find
00:22:44.400 which Stitch row you're on and just cut
00:22:46.000 that Stitch row all the way down and
00:22:48.080 hopefully it'll match up the reason that
00:22:49.799 I don't do that is because most fences
00:22:52.400 or walls they're not perfectly plumbed
00:22:54.480 off so if you follow a Stitcher all the
00:22:56.360 way down and then put it down you might
00:22:58.720 be like an inch off up here and but then
00:23:01.679 be tight up here so that's where these
00:23:03.840 come into play I use these on every
00:23:06.559 install so this makes it really easy for
00:23:08.679 me to get a really precise cut against
00:23:10.840 the
00:23:12.000 wall cuz on the cement I can come like
00:23:15.200 this and I can trim it nice and nice and
00:23:17.799 easily without running into this wall
00:23:19.520 but with the scissors I can actually
00:23:21.279 just kind of follow the wall perfectly
00:23:25.600 without without messing up or taking too
00:23:28.240 much or not
00:23:30.640 enough and when I use these scissors I'm
00:23:33.400 only cutting the backing of the turf I'm
00:23:35.360 really try I'm really trying to not take
00:23:37.440 any of the blades with me cuz I don't
00:23:38.960 want to take huge chunks out and then
00:23:41.360 have it look
00:23:46.480 funny so when I was cutting around this
00:23:49.559 window well right here where our seam
00:23:51.279 was I just made my relief cut like an
00:23:53.919 inch and a half too long I have a pretty
00:23:56.799 sizable Gap right here now I will never
00:23:59.000 leave that looking like that that's lazy
00:24:01.279 it's lucky that I have a seam right here
00:24:03.000 um cuz what I'm going to do is I'm going
00:24:04.240 to cut like a half moon shape like right
00:24:07.799 out of the turf like this and connect it
00:24:10.159 into my seam and then I'm just going to
00:24:11.799 glue all this down this is a low foot
00:24:13.600 traffic area so I'm not worried about it
00:24:15.919 and the reason that I'm cutting a half
00:24:17.279 moon shape is the same reason why I cut
00:24:20.240 the SC seam cuz if I were to just take a
00:24:22.200 box out like this just a rectangle
00:24:24.200 you're going to see that any day of the
00:24:25.720 week so what I'm going to do is I'm
00:24:27.399 going to cut a little curve to it this
00:24:29.080 is uh what we call seam tape so seam
00:24:31.559 tape is what we join uh the two pieces
00:24:33.799 of turf together with there are some
00:24:35.799 people that'll say why don't you just
00:24:37.440 use a two-sided you know sticky adhesive
00:24:40.840 the reason I don't is that sticky stuff
00:24:42.840 it'll rupture over time and then that
00:24:44.679 seam is going to split so using this
00:24:46.279 seam tape and using it in between the
00:24:48.840 seam and while also uh adhering glue to
00:24:52.679 this seam tape is going to be the best
00:24:54.320 option for um longevity of the seam
00:24:57.320 holding up to foot traffic
00:24:59.159 obviously so this is where this is where
00:25:03.240 practice comes in handy so I'm going to
00:25:05.039 take a marker and I'm just going to
00:25:07.880 lightly trace the outside where I need
00:25:12.039 to put it so if you remember the grain
00:25:14.640 part of our our video we want it to be
00:25:17.039 going the same way so obviously I want
00:25:18.440 to pick a piece big enough that's going
00:25:20.520 to you know allow me to have a little
00:25:22.200 bit of overlap to where I can trim this
00:25:23.600 to size uh while also you know fitting
00:25:26.080 exactly in this so I'll go get find a p
00:25:27.880 real
00:25:29.240 quick all right and if I was going to
00:25:31.840 have a patch anywhere here is the ideal
00:25:34.200 spot cuz I have a seam here so I'm
00:25:36.080 already going to be gluing all this so
00:25:37.960 when I'm glue this I'll just peel this
00:25:39.840 back a little bit throw some glue
00:25:43.120 under and roll so I'll peel this side
00:25:46.080 back peel this side back a little bit
00:25:48.960 until what I'm aiming for is I want the
00:25:52.960 top top of the S seam to be right in the
00:25:55.200 middle of the of the tape so I'm going
00:25:57.159 lay lay the seam tape down and then I'm
00:25:58.880 just going to throw a couple of Nails in
00:26:00.039 it just to hold it in place and these
00:26:02.440 are going to be
00:26:09.340 [Music]
00:26:13.039 permanent make sure your seam tape is
00:26:15.919 clean these automatic caulking guns are
00:26:18.880 the best
00:26:20.840 w g what the attempt number
00:26:26.600 two
00:26:35.159 so usually I'll come and kind of thicken
00:26:38.039 up the
00:26:44.880 outside the biggest thing that you want
00:26:46.720 to focus on when you're putting this
00:26:48.120 down we don't want the blades to get
00:26:50.799 into the glue the blades get into the
00:26:52.919 glue it's a little bit messy to uh to
00:26:55.520 get out now if you do get glue in your
00:26:57.399 blade blades it's as easy as getting
00:26:59.399 some paper towel um and then some WD40
00:27:02.799 and then cleaning it off that way so
00:27:04.840 we're going to lay this side down all I
00:27:08.279 all I'm looking for is for it to not
00:27:10.600 fall or the blades not to get in that's
00:27:14.140 [Music]
00:27:20.399 all
00:27:22.840 okay all right so now after we have our
00:27:27.640 seam laid down with the glue we are
00:27:30.039 going to throw some bags of infill on
00:27:32.880 top of the seam to help the glue set up
00:27:35.039 so after you've glued your seam as I had
00:27:36.960 mentioned we don't want the blades to
00:27:38.799 get into the glue cuz it makes mess so
00:27:40.840 what I'm going to do is I'm going to put
00:27:41.799 the bags infill on the seam to help the
00:27:43.720 glue set up uh weigh it down spread the
00:27:45.919 glue out it'll help a little bit so
00:27:47.880 James I'll have you come over and bring
00:27:49.039 me a bag and then as you lay the bag
00:27:52.080 down we want to find where our seam is
00:27:54.279 and we want to pull the blades so
00:27:56.240 they're standing up like this this so
00:27:58.519 put the bag on it on its butt right
00:28:00.360 there then I'm going to pull these these
00:28:03.320 blades up as you lay it down go
00:28:07.120 ahead cuz if we were to just throw we
00:28:10.240 were just throw the bag on like this
00:28:12.360 those blades are going to get sat down
00:28:14.600 into where that glue is then we're going
00:28:16.159 to have to clean it and lay it down for
00:28:18.000 me
00:28:19.620 [Music]
00:28:22.760 yep that's the same for you it's warm
00:28:25.440 out it'll probably set up within 30
00:28:27.600 minutes um that's usually what I
00:28:29.120 normally see if it's a little bit colder
00:28:30.840 it's going to take more like an hour we
00:28:32.720 have our seams glued so now we're going
00:28:34.799 to move on to nailing the perimeter so
00:28:36.720 when you're choosing Nails For You Know
00:28:38.799 securing the turf um you can go common
00:28:40.880 nail galvanized nail both will work
00:28:43.200 great I usually recommend doing a 6-in
00:28:45.039 nail that usually gets the job done
00:28:47.120 pretty good but what I want to focus on
00:28:48.679 is the profile of the head I don't want
00:28:50.399 it too big I want it small enough to
00:28:51.960 where it fits right in between the
00:28:53.200 Stitch rows so we're not seeing every
00:28:55.000 nail head all along the perimeter around
00:28:57.440 places where people are going to be
00:28:58.559 crossing over the turf um I'll do every
00:29:01.279 like 3 to 4 in cuz what I don't want is
00:29:03.799 I I don't want people to be able to kick
00:29:05.120 the turf up and peel it back I want it
00:29:06.640 to stay there and be really tight and
00:29:08.559 then on the perimeter where you know not
00:29:10.159 a lot of people are walking we do every
00:29:11.559 4 to six normally so the technique is
00:29:14.240 you split the blades of grass with your
00:29:16.399 nail come back a stitch row or two
00:29:18.640 remember we don't want to take any
00:29:19.760 blades with us and I'm going to start at
00:29:22.720 an angle and I'm just using the head of
00:29:24.360 my hammer and then as soon as I feel the
00:29:27.080 tip of my nail hit the hard Edge that
00:29:29.039 I'm going up against I'm going to stand
00:29:30.360 it up and as I stand it up as soon as I
00:29:34.360 get to about there I'm going to flip it
00:29:35.880 and use the claw and the reason is I
00:29:37.840 don't want to smash the blades down with
00:29:39.440 the nail and I can be more precise that
00:29:41.679 way if you do it right you can't even
00:29:43.440 see the nail without infill on it so
00:29:45.640 that's a technique that I like to use
00:29:47.360 when nailing down
00:29:48.830 [Music]
00:29:56.320 perimeters
00:29:59.760 so now that we have all of our edges
00:30:01.880 nailed down all of our seams are cut and
00:30:04.320 glued so we're ready to move on to the
00:30:06.200 infill so the infill that that I
00:30:08.679 recommend to use on pretty much any
00:30:10.120 install is going to be envirofill first
00:30:12.679 off it's got this nice green color to it
00:30:14.320 so it Blends in really well secondly it
00:30:16.640 has antimicrobial antibacterial
00:30:19.240 properties to the infill so it helps fil
00:30:21.320 through all the bacteria through the
00:30:22.519 grass so anything that gets into it
00:30:24.480 you're not going to have to worry about
00:30:25.559 that the kicker is it hasn't odor
00:30:27.679 eliminator to it so if you have pets or
00:30:29.840 you have kids you know stuff's going to
00:30:31.760 get into the turf just like your regular
00:30:33.440 yard would so with this enviral fill
00:30:35.360 it's going to help kill any odor that
00:30:37.200 gets into the grass as well as it's
00:30:39.080 going to weigh it down and stand the
00:30:40.720 blades up this is a very crucial part to
00:30:43.360 finishing an install a lot of people use
00:30:45.240 regular silica sand um the reason that I
00:30:47.399 don't recommend regular sand is because
00:30:50.399 regular sand collects a lot of mold and
00:30:52.240 mildew and it's also very coarse so it
00:30:54.559 rubs the backing raw you're not going to
00:30:56.440 get a full 20 your lifespan out of it so
00:30:58.399 we really recommend to go with the
00:31:00.200 enviral fill this is going to help with
00:31:02.240 the longevity of your install as well as
00:31:04.840 you know keep smells out help stand the
00:31:06.880 blades up help it you know look good for
00:31:08.720 a very long time and the installation
00:31:10.399 process of this is this uh drop spreader
00:31:13.000 is the easiest to use we're looking to
00:31:14.960 shoot for about 2 lb a square foot on
00:31:17.159 this grass that we have in front of us
00:31:18.960 um we want to cover about 40% of the
00:31:20.799 blade so the the idea with the drop
00:31:23.080 spreader is you're going to do it just
00:31:24.880 how you mow a lawn so you're going to
00:31:26.399 start on what it
00:31:27.679 you're going to go horizontally back and
00:31:29.559 forth back and forth until you're done
00:31:31.519 and then you're going to go vertically
00:31:32.880 and then once you've done that if you
00:31:33.960 have some more bags just keep running it
00:31:36.039 over until you're all done so on the
00:31:38.159 edges I always fill them by hand cuz
00:31:41.120 that's where all the nails are and
00:31:42.720 that's where you know we usually have we
00:31:45.039 have a little bitty Gap in between our
00:31:47.760 our hard Edge and our turf so I really
00:31:50.120 want to fill this up and the reason I do
00:31:52.240 it is cuz it looks kind of helps with
00:31:54.679 that crisp clean end product
00:31:57.919 this is more of like an OCD thing that I
00:31:59.840 do cuz at the end what we'll do is we'll
00:32:01.799 take a hose and we'll push this all into
00:32:04.639 the edge here obviously you can see it's
00:32:07.000 building up here in the Grass at first
00:32:09.679 thought you might think oh that's enough
00:32:12.559 I'll just start power brooming my
00:32:13.960 infilling but the truth of the matter is
00:32:16.360 is all this stuff is just getting stuck
00:32:18.639 on top of the blades so the power broom
00:32:21.399 is what's going to drive that down into
00:32:23.240 the backing help it stand it up so if we
00:32:26.240 give you 20 bags that sa for your
00:32:28.559 install use all 20 bags um now replacing
00:32:33.000 this later on it's going to rarely
00:32:35.080 happen um most of the time we see that
00:32:38.039 you might have to add a couple of pounds
00:32:39.720 in one spot if it got moved around a
00:32:41.399 little bit every two or so years so
00:32:44.440 maintenance on infill is not uh a
00:32:47.440 requirement um it may happen down the
00:32:50.039 road but as you can see this piling up
00:32:52.760 it may look like enough but once we
00:32:55.360 power broom it it'll all get sunk down
00:32:57.440 into the turf so uh we're going to use
00:32:59.440 all the bags that we have here right
00:33:01.360 here this is our trusty power broom now
00:33:03.880 you can use a push Brom to do this but
00:33:05.720 one of these makes the makes the job a
00:33:07.559 lot easier just a bristle broom
00:33:09.159 attachment on a weed whip and this
00:33:10.519 really helps stand the blades up and
00:33:12.720 drive the
00:33:13.970 [Music]
00:33:15.480 uh don't do this to me right now so if
00:33:18.760 your power broom doesn't work like it
00:33:21.559 just happened to us a stiff bristle
00:33:23.279 broom will do the job for diyers most of
00:33:25.760 the time you know people just don't own
00:33:27.480 the power broom most people have one of
00:33:29.519 these in their house this will do the
00:33:31.960 exact same thing just takes a little bit
00:33:34.200 longer so we're pushing against the
00:33:36.000 grain if you remember earlier we talked
00:33:39.200 about laying the grain to where the
00:33:41.760 customer or yourself if you're doing
00:33:44.279 DIY has the best view of the turf you
00:33:47.799 don't want to broom it this way Dow
00:33:51.039 grain cuz it doesn't stay in the blades
00:33:53.120 up it just lays them down so you want to
00:33:55.519 push against the
00:33:58.039 blades like
00:34:00.240 this to help stand them up along your
00:34:04.320 way another Pro tip that we like to use
00:34:06.799 is that I think will work as a
00:34:15.719 [Music]
00:34:17.219 [Applause]
00:34:18.010 [Music]
00:34:22.320 blower uh just cleaning up these little
00:34:24.800 scraps that sit on top usually a power
00:34:27.079 broom will do a good job at this but
00:34:29.960 today our power broom is out of
00:34:31.560 commission so doing it by hand uh
00:34:35.159 normally these will stick around for
00:34:36.520 about 6 months to a year these little
00:34:38.918 scraps and they'll usually kind of blow
00:34:41.520 away over time so just expect that if
00:34:44.159 you're doing a project um they will be
00:34:46.639 around for a little bit uh watering down
00:34:49.480 after the the infill cuz it'll help
00:34:53.000 compress the infill to the thatch layer
00:34:55.679 or the backing of the grass PR so it'll
00:34:57.960 sit a little
00:35:00.280 lower we just don't want everything
00:35:02.200 sitting on top okay so there we have it
00:35:05.119 there is your eight-step tutorial for a
00:35:08.000 DIY Turf install something quickly I
00:35:10.440 want to go over with you guys is
00:35:11.560 maintenance and what you can expect
00:35:13.280 obviously one of the huge Pros to Turf
00:35:15.880 is number one saving water number two
00:35:17.359 low maintenance the most maintenance
00:35:18.920 that you're going to have to do on a
00:35:20.040 yard like this is simply maybe add a
00:35:23.400 couple of pounds of infill where Parts
00:35:25.480 where it may have gotten shifted around
00:35:26.880 from foot traffic every couple of years
00:35:29.280 that's really what we see other than
00:35:30.720 that it's going to stay good and look
00:35:32.599 good for a very long time if you guys
